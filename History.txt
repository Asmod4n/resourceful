Version 0.6.0
=============

 * Improved support for multi-valued header fields. (Peter Williams)
 * Added convenience mechanisms for making URL encoded and multipart form data requests. (Peter Williams)
 * Ruby 1.9 support (Peter Williams)

Compatibility issues
--------------------

 * The semantics of the Resourceful::Header API have changed slightly.
   Previously, any header might return a string or an array.  Now
   fields are either "single-value" and always return a string, or
   "multi-value" and always return an array.  See API doc for more
   details.
